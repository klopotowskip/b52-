An application written in Spring Boot and React, that reads a data scraped from real estate listings (which are located in the database). After that the data are being summarized and displayed on a React-based interactive dashboard. Leaflet package is being used, so the user may explore the map and select a different districts of the Tricity, in order to explore current average prices of real estates for sale and rent. Chart.js package is being used, so the user may see the mean price changes in time series.

This project was made as a part of my Engineering Thesis -- Analysis of the Real Estate Market in Tricity Using Web Scraping Technology.
